FLASHMON flash memory monitoring tool (Version 2.1)
====================================================
2013/05/23 <pierre.olivier@univ-brest.fr>

DESCRIPTION :
-------------

Flashmon is a Linux kernel module that monitors NAND flash memory access events 
using Kprobes and Jprobes. Flashmon monitors accesses for _bare flash chips_
soldered on embedded boards, managed by the Linux Memory Technology Device 
(MTD) subsystem. Please note that Flashmon will not work for devices that are 
not managed by MTD: SD/MMC cards, USB pen drives, SSD drives, etc.

The monitored events are: flash pages read / write requests, and flash block 
erase operations. Those operations are traced at the MTD subsystem level to 
stay independent from the file system and the device driver.

For more information about Flashmon please see the "FlashmonUserGuide.pdf" file
in the archive.

REQUIREMENTS :
--------------

This module must be loaded on a kernel with KPROBES and KALLSYMS activated. It 
should be fine if a command like 'cat /proc/kallsyms | grep "jprobe"' returns
something on your system.

Compiling & installing flashmon :
---------------------------------

If you are compiling flashmon on the same computer (x86 / amd64) on which you 
are planning to use it, a simple "make -f Makefile.x86" in the flashmon folder 
should do the job.

For cross compiling the module for another architecture, you will have
to edit the Makefile.

To run flashmon, insert the module "flashmon.ko", following the 
instructions in the FlashMonUserGuide.pdf document.

Using Flashmon as a built-in function in the kernel
===================================================
When Flashmon is used as a built-in function in the kernel (as opposed to a 
module), one interesting feature is the fact that Flashmon is loaded before
the file system driver. It then allows to trace flash access at boot time.

Flashmon uses the 'getnstimeofday' function to compute time measurements for
the log of flash accesses. The problem is that sometimes the system time is
not setup very well setup early in the boot process. So there may be is an 
important offset in the time measurements. As that offset is the same for each 
entry of the log, one can cope with this problem by subtracting this offset 
from each measurement (a tool for doing so is available in trunk/Tests/
flashmon_startzero on the flashmon svn repository on sourceforge).

Another problem is the fact that the system time may be setup during the boot 
process (i.e. during flashmon tracing process), leading to inconsistencies in
flashmon time measurements. For now a solution is to disable the system time 
setup at boot time. In the kernel menuconfig go to Device Drivers -> Real Time
Clock -> Set system time from rtc at startup and resume. Another solution would
be for flashmon to have its own timer.
